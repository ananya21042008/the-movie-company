            <p style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;" >During the British era, Malli, a small tribal girl, is taken away by British governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine against the wishes of her mother. Rama Raju is an Indian cop who works for the British army; for him duty comes first, and he is very ruthless to revolutionary Indians but is never given his due by British government. The British government find that a tribal Komaram Bheem, who considers Malli his sister, has started his search for her and could be an obstacle for the British army. The governor and his wife announce a special post for any officer who can bring Bheem to them. Rama Raju decides to take the matters into his own hands and promises the government to bring him in dead or alive. Bheem by now has reached he city in search of Malli and pretends to be a mechanic, Akhtar. During a train accident on a lake he and Rama Raju risk their lives and save a kid and become best of friends. But each man will clash with the other and will thirst for each other's blood in order to complete their missions.
