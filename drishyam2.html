            <p style="font-family: Arial , sans-serif;" >Jab We Met is a romantic comedy film that was released in 2007 in India. The film was directed and written by Imtiaz Ali and produced by Dhillin Mehta. The movie stars Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor in the lead roles, along with other supporting actors.

                The movie revolves around two very different characters, Aditya Kashyap (played by Shahid Kapoor) and Geet Dhillon (played by Kareena Kapoor). Aditya is a depressed businessman who is dealing with the failure of his family's business, while Geet is a free-spirited and talkative young woman who is engaged to be married but runs away from home to elope with her boyfriend.
                
                The two meet on a train journey when Geet, who is upset about her boyfriend's absence, starts a conversation with Aditya. Despite his initial reluctance, Aditya starts to enjoy her company and begins to open up to her. When they arrive at the station, Geet discovers that she has lost her luggage and money, and Aditya reluctantly agrees to help her get to her destination.
                
                As they travel together, Aditya and Geet's personalities clash, but they also begin to develop a deep friendship. However, their journey takes unexpected turns as they face various challenges, including getting stranded in the middle of the night and getting into an accident. Despite the hardships, they support each other and grow closer.
                
                When they finally reach Geet's destination, she discovers that her boyfriend has already married someone else, and she is heartbroken. Aditya offers to take her back home, but she insists on going to Manali, where she has always wanted to go. Aditya agrees to go with her, and they spend a few days together in Manali, enjoying each other's company.
                
                However, their journey comes to an end when Aditya realizes that he has fallen in love with Geet. He confesses his feelings to her, but she tells him that she only sees him as a friend. They part ways, but Aditya's life is forever changed by the experience, and he becomes a happier and more confident person.
